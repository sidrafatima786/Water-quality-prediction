# ðŸŒŠ Week 2 - Water Quality Prediction Project

This week's progress focuses on cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the water quality features better.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded and understood the structure of the dataset
- Identified and handled missing/null values
- Performed initial statistical analysis
- Visualized key parameters influencing water quality

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Stay tuned for Week 3 where we dive into model building and prediction!
